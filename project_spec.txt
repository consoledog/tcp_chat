Server:
    Listens on a TCP port.
    Accepts incoming client connections.
    Keeps track of all connected clients.
    For each incoming message, forwards (“broadcasts”) it to every other client.
Client:
    Connects to the server's address and port
    Runs two loops in parallel:
        Receiver: Listens for messages from the server and prints them
        Sender: Reads user input from the terminal and sends it to the server

Concurency model:
    Threading:  Each client handler runs in its own thread on the server side.
                Each client has a receiver thread
    select/asyncio: Scales better for many connections, but a bit more involved.
